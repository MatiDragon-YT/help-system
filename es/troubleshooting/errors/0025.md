# 0025: Incorrect counter range

A `FOR` [loop](../../coding/loops.md#for-end) gets an invalid range of values to iterate. It may happen when 

* in `FOR..to` the initial value is greater than the final one

or

* in `FOR..downto`  the final value is greater than the initial one.

**Possible solutions:** provide a correct range for the loop:

```
FOR 0@ = 0 to 5
    
END

FOR 0@ = 5 downto 0
    
END
```
