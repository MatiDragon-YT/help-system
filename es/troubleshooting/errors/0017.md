# 0017: Unknown type of variable

The compiler can't recognize the type of a variable. In most cases, it happens as the variable is not declared, or is declared with another type.

**Possible solutions: **give the variable a type using [`VAR..END`](../../coding/variables.md#var-end-construct) construct.
