# 0068: Forbidden character in identifier

The compiler finds an forbidden character in a [variable](../../coding/variables.md) name, [label](../../coding/data-types.md#labels), or any other identifier. Only digits, letters and the underscore (`_`) are allowed.

**Possible solutions:** update the name to include only allowed characters.
