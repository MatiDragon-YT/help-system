# 0036: Local mission variable is out of range

The local variable in a mission body was given a name that exceeds the limit in this game.

**Possible solutions:** update the name to meet the [limits](../../scm-documentation/gta-limits.md) or turn off the `Ranges check` [option](../../editor/options/general.md#ranges-check):

```
1024@ = 1 // error
1023@ = 1 // OK
```
