# 0042: Duplicate external script name

The same name has been used for multiple external scripts. Each script name must be unique.

**Possible solutions:** use a unique name for each external script:

```
DEFINE SCRIPT RACE AT @LABEL
DEFINE SCRIPT RACE AT @LABEL2 // error, RACE has already been used
DEFINE SCRIPT RACE2 at @LABEL2 // OK
```
