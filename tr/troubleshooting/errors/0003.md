# 0003: Error reading script.img

The `script.img` archive accompanying the `main.scm` file is broken or has unknown format. It may happen if this archive was compiled with a different `main.scm` file. Check if both files were compiled at the same time.

**Possible solutions:** replace the `script.img` with the correct file.
