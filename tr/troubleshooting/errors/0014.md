# 0014: Incorrect expression

There is an expression used without an opcode, and the operand types are incompatible. 

The operands are incompatible when:

* one operand is a variable which type has been declared via [`VAR..END`](../../coding/variables.md#var-end-construct), but the type of the other operand is different:

```
var
  0@: Int
end

0@ = 1.0
```

* both operands are variables that were not declared via `VAR..END`
* one of the operands is impossible. For example, a number on the left side of an assignment statement:

```
5=6
```

**Possible solutions:** check the correctness of this expression. Either:

* re-declare the variable with the correct type
* declare both variables using `VAR..END`
* fix the expression using correct values\
