# Sanny Builder Help
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MatiDragon-YT/help-system?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/MatiDragon-YT/help-system/releases)

This is the first offline version of [docs.sannybuilder.com](https://docs.sannybuilder.com/), worked together, to understand much of the GitBook site Markdown and highlight SB3 code easy and quickly.

## About
This repository contains sources for Sanny Builder compiled help files (CHM). Currently the English version exist.\
Based on the original that brings the `help.chm`, GitBook and my own [`help3082.chm`](https://github.com/MatiDragon-YT/doc-chm)

## Collaborations
The world is very welcome to collaborate in what you want with the documentation.\
Providing information, bug reports or optimizing the main script, which brings Markdown to life.

### Creating pages
Just go to the folder that contains the section you want to collaborate on.\
For example to `help-system\scm-documentation\sa\` and create any file with the extension `.HTML` with the following inside.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../../style/style.css">
</head>
<body>

This is a template

<script src="../../../js/main.min.js"></script>
```

## Compiling CHM files
Use HTML Help Workshop v4.
