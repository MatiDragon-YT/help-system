This is the first offline version of [docs.sannybuilder.com](https://docs.sannybuilder.com/), worked to understand the Markdown of the GitBook site and highlight SB3 code with the code blocks labeled `sb3` after the backsticks (<code>&#x0060;</code>).

## Design
Based on the original that brings the `help.chm`, GitBook and [my own `help3082.chm`](https://github.com/MatiDragon-YT/doc-chm)

This repository contains sources for Sanny Builder compiled help files (CHM). Currently the English version exist.

## Compiling CHM files
Use HTML Help Workshop v4.

## Reporting issues
Create a ticket against the new documentation portal: https://github.com/MatiDragon-YT/help-system/issues The CHM help is no longer maintained.
