**Sanny Builder** is a fast and powerful tool designed for the GTA 3D game series (GTA3, VC, SA, LCS; partially VCS).
.
It includes a disassembler, permitting the end-user to transform the game scripts into text. The compiler feature offers a convenient editor with a large number of [useful functions](editor/features.html) such as syntax highlighting, error checking, advanced search tools, player coordinates reading, fast movement through code and much more.
.
Sanny offers an advanced code syntax which is similar to existing programming languages. This syntax includes changeable [classes](coding/classes.html), [keywords](coding/keywords.html) and high-level statements. We recommend you continue reading and fully explore the documentation to learn more about SB and its capabilities. We provide a wealth of information that will help you get started in mission coding.

## Installation and Updates

Run the installer and follow its instructions. During installation you could optionally select the game directory you plan to work with, associate files with the  `.scm` extension with Sanny Builder and install the [CLEO library](https://cleo.li/).  You can always update these settings in the [program options](editor/options.html).
.
To uninstall the program, run the file `unins000.exe` located in its root folder.
