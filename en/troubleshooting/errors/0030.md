# 0030: Invalid number of elements

The compiler expects to find either a number of missions or external scripts but finds something different. In most cases, it happens when the number of elements in the preceding section of the header of the `main.scm` does not match the defined value.

**Possible solutions:** check if each header section has the correct number of elements:

```text
DEFINE OBJECTS 1
DEFINE OBJECT INFO
DEFINE OBJECT KEYCARD // error, the number of objects(2) is greater than expected (1)

DEFINE MISSIONS 0 
```
