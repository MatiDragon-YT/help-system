# 0016: Script not found

The disassembler can't find a mission or an external script at the location listed in the `main.scm` header. More often, it happens when `script.img` was altered after compiling or was compiled along with another `main.scm`.

**Possible solutions:** toggle the [debug option](../../editor/console.md#ignore_unknown) `IGNORE_UNKNOWN`.
