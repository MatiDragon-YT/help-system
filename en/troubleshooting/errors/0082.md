# 0082: Invalid syntax

The compiler finds a syntactic element that can't be used in the current context. 

For example, it happens if the word `else` is found outside of a [conditional statement](../../coding/conditions.md#high-level-constructs).

**Possible solutions:** check the related documentation and make the code syntax valid.
