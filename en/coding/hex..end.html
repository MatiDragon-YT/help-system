Sanny Builder supports writing raw content into an output file. Within this construct, all values are directly written in an output file without undergoing any checks.

:::warning
Use this feature only if you know what you're doing. Any mistakes will corrupt the script file making it unreadable by the game or a script editor.

## Syntax

```sb3
hex
    <,any hexadecimal numbers>
end
```

```sb3
hex
    04 00 02 0800 04 01
end
```

This sequence of bytes is the compiled version of the opcode `0004: $2 = 1`, so the game will correctly read it and set the value of the variable `$2` to `1`.

Each byte consists of two digits. The compiler ignores any spaces, effectively treating a pair of two digits separated by a space as one value. Additionally, when there's an unpaired digit, it is automatically prefixed with a leading `0`.

For example, a sequence of three letters `A B C` will be compiled as the number `0xAB0C`.

The `HEX..END` construct also accepts [string literals](data-types.md#string-literals), [labels](data-types.md#labels), [global variables](variables.md#global-variables), [model names](data-types.md#model-names). They are compiled without a preceding data type byte.

```sb3
:get_offset
hex
    04 00 02 $PLAYER_CHAR 01 @get_offset
end
```

This is the exact copy of the opcode `0004: $PLAYER_CHAR = @get_offset`

A string literal enclosed in double quotes is compiled as a sequence of characters.

```sb3
hex
    "This is a string"
end
```

## Escape Sequences

The following escape sequences are supported within a string literal:

|Name|Escape Sequence|Byte Form|
|-|
|Null|\0|00|
|Backspace|\b|08|
|Tab|\t|09|
|Line Feed|\n|0A|
|Carriage Return|\r|0D|
|Numeric escape sequence|\x`nn`|`nn`|
|Escape char|\`char`|`char`|

```sb3
hex
    "\\0\\b\\t\\n\\r\\xDD"
end
```

It produces the following sequence of bytes: `00 08 09 0A 0D DD`.

Currently multiple spaces in a string literal are converted into a single one. Thus a line `"This    is  a     string"` is converted into `"This is a string"`. Use the backward slash character `\` to add multiple spaces in a string literal: `"This \ \ \ is \ a \ \ \ \ string"`.

## Entering large numbers

For convenience, large numbers can be prefixed with an `&` symbol. The number following the `&` symbol can be positive or negative, and it can be represented in either decimal or hexadecimal format.

```sb3
hex
    &1000 &-0xA33500 
end
```

This example produces the following sequence of bytes: `E8 03 00 CB 5C FF`.

## Byte Repetition

In cases where it is necessary to repeat a specific byte multiple times, such as when creating a zero-filled buffer, indicate the count by appending `(n)` after the byte, where `n` is a positive integer number:

```sb3
hex
    00(10)
end
```

This syntax is equivalent to:

```sb3
hex
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
end
```

Byte repetitions can be used multiple times within the same block, and they can also be set with a constant value.

```sb3
const n = 25
hex
    00(n) 01(3) 02(4)
end
```

## Including binary files

`hex..end` allows usage of the `$INCLUDE` directive to embed the contents of a binary file directly into the script's body. The syntax is as follows:

```sb3
hex 
    {$INCLUDE <,path>}
end
```

Path resolution follows the rules set for the [{$INCLUDE}](directives.md#usdinclude) directive.
