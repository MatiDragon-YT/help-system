Sanny Builder supports writing a raw content in an output file. All values within this construct are written in an output file without any checks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use this feature only if you know what you're doing. Any mistakes will corrupt the script file making it unreadable by the game or a script editor.
{% endhint %}

## Syntax

`HEX`\
`    <any hexadecimal numbers>`\
`END`

```sb3
hex
    04 00 02 0800 04 01
end
```

This sequence of bytes is the compiled version of the opcode `0004: $2 = 1`, so the game will correctly read it and set the value of the variable `$2` to `1`.

You must specify each byte you're going to write with two digits. All spaces are ignored. The compiler treats any two digits with a space between them as a single byte value. A single digit (`0..F`) is prefixed with `0`. So, for example, a sequence of three letters`A B C` will be compiled as the number `0xAB0C`.

The `HEX..END` construct also accepts [string literals](data-types.md#string-literals), [labels](data-types.md#labels), [global variables](variables.md#global-variables), [model names](data-types.md#model-names). They are compiled without a preceding data type byte.

```sb3
:get_offset
hex
    04 00 02 $PLAYER_CHAR 01 @get_offset
end
```

This is the exact copy of the opcode `0004: $PLAYER_CHAR = @get_offset`

A string literal enclosed in double quotes is compiled as a sequence of characters.

```sb3
hex
    "This is a string"
end
```

## Escape Sequences

The following escape sequences are supported within a string literal:

|Name|Escape Sequence|Byte Form|
|-|
|Null|\0|00|
|Backspace|\b|08|
|Tab|\t|09|
|Line Feed|\n|0A|
|Carriage Return|\r|0D|
|Numeric escape sequence|\x`nn`|`nn`|
|Escape char|\`char`|`char`|

```sb3
hex
    "\0\b\t\n\r\xDD"
end
```

It produces the following sequence of bytes: `00 08 09 0A 0D DD`.

Currently multiple spaces in a string literal are converted into a single one. Thus a line `"This    is  a     string"` is converted into `"This is a string"`. Use the backward slash character `\` to add multiple spaces in a string literal: `"This \ \ \ is \ a \ \ \ \ string"`.

## Using aDMA Numbers

Also you can use the [aDMA](data-types.md#variables) data type to write a numeric constant in an output file. The number after the `&` sign can be both positive or negative, decimal or hexadecimal.

```sb3
hex
    &1000 &-0xA33500 
end
```

This example produces the following sequence of bytes: `E8 03 00 CB 5C FF`.
