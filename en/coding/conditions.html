The `IF` operator evaluates one or more conditions and creates a new branch of code.

## Low-level IF statements

`00d6: if <N>`\
`<condition 1>`\
`<condition 2>`\
`...`\
`<condition N+1>`\
`004D: jump_if_false <label>`\
\
`N` means the total number of conditions within the IF statement and the way the evaluation of conditions happens.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>

</tr>

{% hint style="info" %}
A single IF statement can contain up to 8 conditions. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Sanny Builder allows to omit  `0` after `IF. IF 0` and  `IF` are equivalent.
{% endhint %}

- `<label>`- a name of the [label](data-types.md#labels) where script jumps if the IF statement is false.
- `<condition>` - any conditional opcode evaluating to `true` or `false` 

If you have the  `Conditions check` enabled in the [options](../editor/options/general.md#check-conditions), you can replace the if number with the keywords `AND` or `OR`. The compiler calculates the correct value itself.

```sb3
if and 
    $var > 0
    $var2 == 10.0
jf @anywhere
```

The compiler writes the number `1` instead of `and`.\
\
`IF AND` - conditions connected with the logical operator `AND` (a replacement for `if 1..7`)\
`IF OR` - conditions connected with the logical operator `OR ` (a replacement for `if 21..27`)

## High-level Constructs

To make writing conditions easier there are high-level constructs that don't require any additional labels:\
`IF <N>/AND/OR`\
`  <condition 1>`\
`  <condition 2>`\
`  ...`\
`  <condition N+1>`\
`THEN`\
`  <commands if the statement is true>`\
`END`
<br><br>
`IF <N>/AND/OR`\
`  <condition 1>`\
`  <condition 2>`\
`  ...`\
`  <condition N+1>`\
`THEN`\
`  <commands if the statement is true>`\
`ELSE`\
`  <commands if the statement is false>`\
`END`

.
A condition is created by the rules described for [low-level conditions](conditions.md#low-level-if-statements). After `THEN` you have to specify the command(-s) that are executed if the condition is met. After `ELSE` you have to specify the command(-s) that are executed if the condition is not met.

The `IF` statement is closed with the word `END`.

```sb3
if $var == 5
then
    Inc($var)
else
    Dec($var)
end
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The  [`Conditions check`](../editor/options/general.md#check-conditions) option  has to be enabled.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Nested IF statements are supported.
{% endhint %}

## Relational Operators

* a **`==`** b - a is equal to b 
* a **`>=`** b - a is greater than or equal to b 
* a **`>`** b - a is greater than b 
* a **`<`** b - a is less than b 
* a **`<=`** b - a is less than or equal to b 
* a **`<>`** b - a is not equal to b

`a` and `b` are operands. The compiler is able to figure out an opcode if one of the operands is a number or a [string literal](data-types.md#string-literals), or both [variable' type](variables.md#var-end-construct) is known.
