In this tutorial I (Alexander) will tell you everything I know about scripting in GTA San Andreas.
So let's go !!!

In the text you can meet the words in double quotation marks, quotation marks exist only for the convenience of reading, write them in the context of the builder is not necessary !!!
For scripting in SA the program Sanny Builer is used, then just SB, there is also BW's builder, but about it I have not written a tutorial yet. All that you will read refers to SB version no less than 2.97. If you haven't downloaded it yet, go to [https://www.sannybuilder.com](https://www.sannybuilder.com).
Start SB, in the menu select the category "Tools", find the column "Options", click on it. The window will appear and you need to find the "GTA SA directory" option and enter the path to your installed SA. Press "F5" and choose where the main script file is - main.scm. He lies in: "directory GTA SA/data/script", then press "Open".
Here it is and compiled, and you'll see a lot of numbers and words. The whole script consists of commands. The whole command is written in one line. Previously, each command consisted of an opcode and parameters.
For example:

```sb3
009A: $act = create_actor 4 #WMYCR at $x $y $z
```

`009A` - is an opcode, it shows which action should be performed.
`$act` - is an actor (or just a dude).
`4` - is a type of actor, the types described in the chapter ["Ped Types"](../scm-documentation/sa/pedtypes.md).
`#WMYCR` - is the actor's model.
`$x $y $z` - are the coordinates of the actor on the map, they should always be with a point, i.e. they should be rounded to at least tenths.
`009A: $act = 4 #WMYCR $x $y $z` - I could have written it that way, because only the parameters play a role in a command with an opcode, and you can't do that in a command without an opcode (about them later).
The entire compiled main.scm consists of threads, and missions, which in turn are also threads. Writing missions is the hardest part of scripting. Threads are also called threads. All variables (actor names, vehicle names, coordinates...) must start with a `$` sign (usable throughout your Main text) or end with a `@` sign (usable within threads only), as for data types, see chapter ["data types"](../coding/data-types.md).
Sanny now (08.2006) mostly uses the new opcode type without commands. Here is the same opcode I described before, but now under current SB:

```sb3
Actor.Create($act,4,#WMYCR,$x,$y,$z)
```

You see, it's almost the same, only much more convenient, you just have to write a code word like actor, car or object... and then put a dot and you'll see a little menu with the actions\
that you can do with this type of object.
The threads consist of labels. A label is a sort of self-contained part of a stream, the context is as follows: it stands alone in a line and always begins with a colon; the name of any stream is defined by the name of its first label.
To create a thread, you need to find a line with the text create_thread, then after it insert `create_thread @"name of your thread"` on the next line, no quotation marks. Then you need to find the line with the text -Mission 0- and before it write :
1) The name of the script you declared with the `create_thread @` command.
2) Be sure to write the command wait 0, instead of zero you can write any time (in milliseconds) after which your thread will be executed.
3) Each thread must end with a line with the text `end_thread`.
For example:
I found lines that have the expression `create_thread @` as part of them, after them I inserted the line

```sb3
create_thread @Test 
```

Then I found the line `-Mission 0-`.
Above it I wrote

```sb3
:Test
wait 0

//---------- You have to write what the thread is doing. -------------

end_thread
```

To use actors, machines, objects in your thread, you must first load their models.
This is done with several commands:
1) `model.load(#WMYCR)` , where `#WMYCR` is the actor model you want.
2) `038B: load_requested_models` , this command loads previously declared models (in our case this is model `#WMYCR`).
You can write as much as you want `model.load(#requested_model)`, but after you have declared the desired models you must always write the command `038B: load_requested_models`, otherwise the game will crash.
You must always write a check for loading models, or if the model is not yet loaded, and you already do something with it, the game will crash. Here is an example of the standard stream content (beginning, loading models, checking for loading, end):
As always, we create a thread (how to do this was written before), and now:

```sb3
:Test //the name of the stream or its 1st label
wait 0 //wait 0 milliseconds (1 sec.=1000 msec.)
model.load(#required model N° 1) 
model.load(#required model N° 2) 
model.load(#required model N° n) //write down the models we need for the flow
038B: load_requested_models //Load the models we need for the flow
 :Test_2   // This is a new label
wait 0 //wait for 0 milliseconds.
if and //If and-command starts a condition, all subconditions of which are satisfied. 
model.Available(#required model N° 1) // Condition 
model.Available(#required model N° 2) // Condition 
model.Available(#required model N° n) // Condition 
jf @Test_2 // jf means that if these subsets are not fulfilled, then
// execution of the thread goes to the beginning of the check
   
//-- This is where you have to write what the thread does. --
   
Model.Destroy(#required model N° 1) // at the end of each thread you have to 
Model.Destroy(#required model N° 2) // unload models from memory, or they 
Model.Destroy(#required model N° n) //stay there and contaminate it 
end_thread // End of flow
```

Regarding conditions everything is written in chapter ["Conditions"](../coding/conditions.md).
To apply all that you wrote it is necessary to press "F7" (compilation), then start SA by pressing "F8", each time after a new compilation it is necessary to start a new game, if you will load your save, the game at the end of loading will simply give an error and will exit.
To determine the coordinates in the game is used Coords Manager, this is part of SB. If SA is running then by pressing "F4" when SB window is active an additional window will appear in SB window where player coordinates will be written, with Coords Manager you can set player coordinates, just enter desired coordinates and press "Set" and player will move to specified point.
