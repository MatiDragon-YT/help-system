One way to load `main.scm` without modifying the original is in MPACK.\
That gives us the opportunity to select the desired mode when starting a new game, from the available list.

---

We just need to create a folder called `MPACK` in the directory "My Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files". Now the game will understand that the player needs to choose a `main`.

To do this, we must first create another folder as follows, with which we configure the order of the list:

> MPACK + Sequence number

The sequence number is integer from 1 to 24.

:::info
Note that there should not be identical numbers.
:::

For example, we are going to create a folder called `MPACK1`.

Now inside the folder do the following:

1. Create a `mpack.dat` file with a normal notepad.\nOpen it and add the following entry: `1#Testeo MD v1.0#`. <blockquote>`1` - the sequence number of the mission set.\n`Testeo MD v1.0` - the name of the set, will be displayed when selected. It must be written in Latin letters, as the game does not always recognize the encoding.</blockquote>
2. Add files: `american.gxt` from the `GTASA\text` folder and `main.scm` from the `GTASA\data\script` folder.
3. Rename `main.scm` to `scr.scm` and `american.gxt` to `text.gxt`

Now our package is ready. When we launch a new game, this we will see:

The standard game is the main one found in the `GTASA\data\script` folder.\
The other will launch our `main` customed.

:::warning
* All CLEO scripts will work when running any MPACK, so if they do interact with the `main` in any way, you should take this into account.
* You can only add up to a maximum of 24 packages.
* In mission packs, external scripts cannot be downloaded (plugins required)
* If you installed the mission pack incorrectly, you will see the following:

:::c bg-black-2 white p-5 h6 d-inline-block
Load failed!

The current Mission Pack is not available.\
Please recheck that the current Mission Pack\
is installed correctly.

Press RETURN to start a new standard game.
