<h2>Sanny Builder</h2>
<p>Sanny Builder is a fast and powerful tool designed for the GTA 3D game series (GTA3, VC, SA; partially LCS and VCS).</p>

<p>It includes a disassembler, permitting the end-user to transform the game scripts into text. The compiler feature offers a convenient editor with a large number of useful functions such as syntax highlighting, error checking, advanced search tools, player coordinates reading, fast movement through code and much more.</p>

<p>Sanny offers an advanced code syntax which is similar to existing programming languages. This syntax includes changeable classes, keywords and high-level statements. We recommend you continue reading and fully explore the help section to learn more about SB and its capabilities. We provide a wealth of information that will help you get started in mission coding. Now that you have discovered some of the possibilities.</p>
